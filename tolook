# 🔹 PHASE : CHECKOUT + ORDER CREATION (FULL FLOW)
# We’ll divide this into 6 clear steps:
# 1️⃣ What checkout actually means
# 2️⃣ Checkout page (frontend)
# 3️⃣ Backend checkout API
# 4️⃣ Payment (Stripe logic)
# 5️⃣ Order creation in database
# 6️⃣ Clearing the cart

# 1️⃣ WHAT “CHECKOUT” REALLY IS
# Checkout is NOT just a button.
# It is a secure transaction flow:
# Cart (frontend)
#    ↓
# Backend validates prices
#    ↓
# Payment provider (Stripe)
#    ↓
# Payment confirmation
#    ↓
# Create order in DB
# ⚠️ Rule:
# 👉 Never trust cart totals from frontend
# 👉 Backend recalculates everything
